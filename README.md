### Installation guide

#### Perquisites

This project is based on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), which is required to run it.

#### Installing Dependencies

This bot uses multiple dependencies, which can be installed by running `npm install` in the root folder after installing NodeJS.

#### Get a Discord API key

Go to [Developers Section](https://discordapp.com/developers) and create an application by following the instructions.
The API key you have generated by this is inserted into the **config.json** file to connect the bot authentication to your instance of the bot.

### Inviting the bot to your test server

To invite the bot to your development server, visit the following link where you replace **XXXX** with the **client_id** of your bot, which can be found on the site from the previous step: [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXX&scope=bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=XXXXX&scope=bot).

### Customizing the configuration
The file **config.json.example** contains the environment variables that should be set for the bot to work.
It requires your discord API token, COTW channel, champion role and manager role.
In addition to this, it requires your Habitica token, to be able to fetch the COTW information from Habitica API.

### Powering up the bot
